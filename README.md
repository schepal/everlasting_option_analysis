# Everlasting Options Analysis
Inspired by the [original research](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/05/everlasting-options/) from [Dave White](https://twitter.com/_Dave__White_) and [Sam Bankman-Fried](https://twitter.com/SBF_Alameda), I was interested in exploring how to theoretically backtest an everlasting option using historical Deribit data. A detailed writeup of this analysis can be found [here](https://www.samchepal.com/a-theoretical-and-empirical-analysis-of-everlasting-options/).


Thanks to Dave White for walking me through the theory of everlasting options and his extensive involvement in reviewing the code and written work for this research project.
